## Set of demos for CDL

Demo 1: [HuaRong-Dao](huarongdao.html?remote=false), a sliding blocks puzzle with a few
variations: classical HuaRong-Dao, a variant of Rush Hour, and the 15 puzzle.

Demo 2: [Flip](invert.html?remote=false), where you have to flip tiles to clear the pattern.
There are two similar games with different rules.
